# Introduction
## MTCNN
MTCNN stands for Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks. It is a face detection algorithm that uses a cascaded architecture to detect faces and facial landmarks such as the eyes, nose, and mouth. It is trained to detect faces in images and is able to handle a wide range of face poses and scales. It is a popular algorithm for face detection and has been used in many applications such as face recognition and facial expression analysis.

## OpenCV Haar cascade
Haar cascade is a machine learning object detection method used to identify objects in images or video. It is trained from positive and negative images. Haar cascades are trained from positive images containing the object of interest and negative images not containing the object. The algorithm is based on the Haar wavelet, which is used to analyze the image and detect features that correspond to the object. The trained classifier is then used to detect the object in new images. Haar cascades are commonly used in face and eye detection, and have been implemented in OpenCV library.
